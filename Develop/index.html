                    This site was created following 2 full weeks-worth of coding bootcamp.  Note the evolution of sites from the initial pre-work site, to this site.  Gradient background coloring, text blur and animated header are just a few of the features that I've built into this site.

                This represents my ability to take a pre-built site and ensure that it's converted to utilize symantic tags as well as adding far more descriptive code so that visitors that may have disabilities will still be able to understand and interact with it.
